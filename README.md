# The X-IoT Approach

This project provide the ADOxx library necessary to model and develop Cross-platform IoT Applications, following the X-IoT approach.

 In particular this project include:
- the ALL Library necessary to model the IoT Application in a platform-indepenent view;
- the ADOScript required to refine the model following the necessity of the target IoT platform;
- The ADOScript required to export the information in JSON, XML or CSV files;
- a demo model in adl format containing some pre-created files with the required information.

More informations are available in the wiki.

## Overview

In this section our approach is presented.
X-IoT (read as cross-IoT) is a novel model-driven approach that uses a high level of abstraction to realise Cross-Platform IoT applications, solving the issues caused by adopting different IoT platforms.

Our approach introduces a Domain-Specific Modelling Language (DSML) which development is guided by the Agile Modelling Method Engineering (AMME) approach.
